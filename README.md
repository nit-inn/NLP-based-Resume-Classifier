# NLP-based-Resume-Classifier

An end-to-end machine learning pipeline to classify resumes from unstructured `.pdf` / `.docx` files and structured `.csv` metadata. This project was developed as part of the **Piramal Finance Hackathon 2024**, combining advanced NLP techniques and classical machine learning models.

---

## ðŸš€ Pipeline Overview

### ðŸ“„ Document Parsing
- Used `PlumPDF`, `PyPDF2`, and `python-docx` to extract raw text from PDF and DOCX resumes.

### ðŸ§¹ Preprocessing
- Utilized `regex` and `NLTK` for:
  - Tokenization  
  - Stopword removal  
  - Text normalization

### ðŸ§  Feature Engineering
- Text features:
  - `TF-IDF`  
  - `Word2Vec`  
  - Optional: LLM-based embeddings (e.g. OpenAI/BERT)
- Metadata features:
  - Encoded using `LabelEncoder` from structured `.csv` data

### ðŸ“Š Modeling
- Trained models:
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Random Forest  
  - XGBoost  
- Libraries: `scikit-learn`, `xgboost`

### ðŸ“ˆ Scoring & Evaluation
- Metrics:
  - Accuracy  
  - F1 Score  
  - ROC-AUC  
- Resume Scoring:
  - Based on skill and keyword match with job requirements
